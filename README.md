##About Me
I am a Masters student in the Computer Science Department of Stony Brook University. I am interested in systems research and prior to joining Stony Brook University, I was working in systems and storage domain for 4 years.

##Graduate Courses
- [CSE 504](http://seclab.cs.sunysb.edu/sekar/cse504/) Compiler Design (Fall 2016)
- [CSE 506](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ezk/cse506-f16/) Operating Systems (Fall 2016)
- [CSE 548](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~rezaul/CSE548-F16.html) Analysis of Algorithms (Fall 2016)
- [CSE 549](https://rob-p.github.io/CSE549F16/) Computational Biology (Fall 2016)

##Academic Projects
- E-- compiler<br>
  Developed a compiler for the E-- language using flex, bison and C++.
- Mergesort system call<br>
  Developed a Linux kernel module to support a new system call which merge sorts input files and writes sorted records to output file.
- Trfs (stackable file system with operation-tracing support)<br>
  Developed a new file system - trfs to capture records of file system activity. These records are written to a file on disk which is       later used by a user-land program to replay the traced operations.
- Linux kernel-based system to support per process system call vectors<br>
  Modified Linux kernel and developed new system call vector modules to support system calls on a per process basis.
